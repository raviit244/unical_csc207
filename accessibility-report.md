# Accessibility Report

## Principles of Universal Design

### 1. Equitable Use
- Calendar interface uses standard date/time formats and clear layouts that work for users regardless of experience level
- Login/signup flows follow familiar patterns accessible to all users
- Could improve by adding screen reader support for visually impaired users

### 2. Flexibility in Use
- Supports multiple calendar services (Google, Notion) accommodating user preferences
- Allows viewing events in both month and day views
- Includes keyboard shortcuts for common actions (Ctrl+A for Add, Ctrl+D for Delete, etc.)
- Could add customizable color schemes and text sizing

### 3. Simple and Intuitive Use
- Clear labeling of all buttons and fields (e.g., "Add Event", "Delete Event")
- Consistent navigation between views with intuitive layout
- Error messages provide clear feedback on invalid inputs
- Tooltips explain button functions

### 4. Perceptible Information
- Events are visually distinguished by calendar source using different colors
- Important actions have dedicated buttons rather than hidden menus
- Keyboard shortcuts are indicated in tooltips
- Could improve by adding high contrast mode and audio feedback

### 5. Tolerance for Error
- Confirms before deleting events to prevent accidents
- Form validation prevents invalid date/time entries
- Clear error messages explain what went wrong
- Allows cancellation of add/edit operations

### 6. Low Physical Effort
- Month view shows event previews without requiring clicks
- Merge calendar feature reduces manual comparison
- Comprehensive keyboard navigation support reduces mouse dependency
- Arrow keys for calendar navigation

### 7. Size and Space for Approach and Use
- Calendar cells are reasonably sized for clicking
- Buttons and text fields use standard sizing
- Consistent spacing between interface elements
- Could add zoom functionality for better visibility

## Target Market

UniCal would appeal to knowledge workers and professionals who regularly coordinate across multiple organizations and systems. The ability to merge and view events across Google Calendar, Notion, and Outlook makes it especially valuable for consultants, freelancers, or employees working with multiple clients or companies. The simple interface, automatic syncing, and comprehensive keyboard shortcuts would save time for users who currently manually check multiple calendars.

## Demographic Considerations

Our calendar application could unintentionally exclude or create barriers for several demographic groups, potentially causing both tangible and relational harm. The desktop-based graphical interface, while familiar to many users, may present challenges for visually impaired users who rely on screen readers. The requirement to manage multiple calendar services and authentication processes could exclude elderly users, who, as highlighted in our ethics discussions, often face greater tangible consequences from digital exclusion. The application's assumption that users can easily distinguish between color-coded calendars reflects a common design bias where developers create interfaces that work well for users similar to themselves but may exclude colorblind users. Additionally, the English-only interface may create barriers for non-English speakers and users from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, potentially communicating that these users are "less than equal" to others. These limitations need to be addressed to avoid perpetuating both tangible and relational inequality.
